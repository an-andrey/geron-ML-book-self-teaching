My exercise and notes when self-learning machine learning using GÃ©ron's Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow textbook.

Although they are minimal and straight forward, to repliacte my notes, download all required libaries using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and run any file needed.
